# Quick start

1.Dataset processing: Firstly, name the dataset as **G.txt**, and then process the data with **Predata** to generate some necessary files for subsequent use. The dataset should be placed in **APSim/TestData/dataset/your_dataset_name** folder, and modify the **dataset_str** variable in the Predata file to your dataset folder address.

2.Modify the path address: Enter **APSim.cpp** file, modify the **path_predata** variable data for your dataset address, modify the **path_query** variable for your query file address, modify the **path_result_root** variable for the experimental results of the output address.

3.Modify parameters: Modify **PathLength and delta** to get different experimental results.
